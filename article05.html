        <div class="post-content">
                    <p><b><i>What's the meaning of life?</b> (This is not an essay arguing for a definitive answer; it simply shares non-personal perspectives from different angles.)</i></p>
          <p>In a movie called <b><i>"Soul"</b></i>, it tells the difination of meaningness:</p>
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <img src="https://img.voguehk.com/media/2021/02/pixar_soul_disney_stream.2e16d0ba.fill-735x490.png" alt="Examined Life documentary poster">
</div>    
          <p> One character in Soul works as a barber named <b><i>Dez</b></i>. He is incredibly skilled and clearly enjoys cutting hair. Because of this, Joe has always assumed that barbering must be Dez’s <b><i>“spark” — the thing that gives his life meaning.</b></i> To <b><i>Joe</b></i>, it seems obvious: if someone is good at something and loves doing it, that must be what they were born for.</p>
          <p>But when <b><i>22</b></i>, temporarily inhabiting Joe’s body, chats with Dez out of curiosity, a different story emerges. Dez reveals that his real dream was never to become a barber. He wanted to be a veterinarian. Unfortunately, his family could not afford the cost of veterinary school, so he chose a barber school instead, simply because it was cheaper. That practical decision ended up shaping the course of his entire life.</p>
          <p>At first, Joe and 22 assume this must mean Dez is living with regret — that giving up his dream must have made him unhappy. But Dez surprises them. He says he is genuinely happy. Even though barbering was not his dream, and even though he does not believe he was “born” to cut hair, his work allows him to meet all kinds of people and make them feel good about themselves. And to him, that is more than enough to make life feel meaningful.</p>
          <p> Dez’s response hits Joe and 22 like a wake-up call. <b><i>They have been chasing the idea that a “spark” is the purpose of life — the one thing you are meant to do.</b></i> Yet through Dez, they realize something far more complicated and far more human: <b><i>many people are forced to let go of their dreams for practical reasons, but that does not mean they lose their joy, their warmth, or their love for life.</b></i></p>
          <h2><b><i>Nihilism</i></b></h2>        
          <p> The nihilism discussed by <b><i>Nietzsche</b></i> is not a simple denial of life’s value. Rather, it points to an unavoidable condition: when traditional religion, morality, and social norms lose their persuasive power, human beings are left to confront the absence of meaning. The issue, then, is not whether life possesses meaning in itself, but <b><i>whether we dare to continue living in a world without predetermined answers.</b></i> Nietzsche opposed a passive form of nihilism—one that outwardly clings to moral order while inwardly denying life itself. What he advocated instead was an <b><i>active nihilism</b></i>: after acknowledging that the world offers no inherent meaning, one must take responsibility for creating value in one’s own life.</p>
          <p> From this perspective, Soul approaches the question of life’s meaning with maturity. The film does not insist that everyone must discover a singular calling or fulfill a lifelong dream to justify their existence. On the contrary, it repeatedly dismantles this obsession. <b><i>Joe’s misunderstanding of his “spark” and 22’s fear of life both stem from the same assumption: that life must point toward a clearly defined goal, and that without it, everything is meaningless.</b></i></p>
          <p> Yet, as Nietzsche reminds us, the real question has never been <b><i>“What am I destined to become?”</b></i> but rather <b><i>“Am I willing to take responsibility for the life I am living right now?”</b></i> The seemingly ordinary moments in the film—a meal, a breeze, a brief conversation—are precisely what allow life to shine again, without the need for any grand purpose. This is neither destiny nor talent, but an affirmation of the present.</p>
          <p> Nietzsche’s thought experiment of eternal recurrence asks us to continually question ourselves: if this moment were to be repeated infinitely, would I still choose to live it this way? The answer offered by Soul is not radical, but quietly tender. <b><i>As long as you are willing to live, to feel, and to form genuine connections with the world, then even without a great dream, your life is already worth repeating.</b></i></p>
          <p> <b><i>Perhaps a “spark” is not a mission waiting to be discovered, but something that is truly ignited only when we decide to live earnestly.</b></i></p>
          <div class="quote-section">
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The meaning of your life is defined the moment you decide to find a meaning for your life.</p>
